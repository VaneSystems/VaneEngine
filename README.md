## Vane Engine (early development)

A 2D/3D game engine written in C++ with Vulkan/D3D11/D3D12/OpenGL support and a Qt-based editor.

It uses CMake as build system for cross-platform support.

It allows cross-compilation.

### Goal

Mostly educational but planning to be serious about it. I would like it to be my main project for a while and be the engine that I use for most of my games.
